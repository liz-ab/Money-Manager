# Money-Manager
About the project 

As a college student, i always found it pretty hard to manage my pocket money and end up overspending, so we thought why not create a site that lets you allot a certain budget to each category you'd be spending money on in order to keep track of the remaining budget on each of those categories. Its a simple site thats very user friendly.
