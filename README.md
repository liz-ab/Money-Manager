### Project Description
As a college student, we always found it pretty hard to manage our pocket money and end up overspending, so we thought why not create a site that lets you allot a certain budget to each category you'd be spending money on in order to keep track of the remaining budget on the same. It's a user friendly site that helps people achieve the same.

### The Problem statement
Individuals struggling to manage money properly.

### The Solution
Design and develop a web application to help individuals manage their finances efficiently.
